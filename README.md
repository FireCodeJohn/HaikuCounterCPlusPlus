# HaikuCounterCPlusPlus

Counts the number of Hiakus in the input file(s).
Simply run the executable HaikuCounterCPlusPlus/x64/Debug/HaikuCPlusPlus.exe

The program gets files from the working directory as input.
The working directory for this program is hard coded to C:\HaikuCPlusPlus_WorkingFolder
9 .txt test files are included in the HaikuCPlusPlus folder (test1.txt - test9.txt), 3 of which are valid haikus.
You should copy these 9 files into C:\HaikuCPlusPlus_WorkingFolder, and also any other test files you have.

If you add text file inputs of your own to the working directory, put 1 haiku in each text file. If you attempt to put 2 haikus in 1 file it will be evaluated as 1 invalid haiku with 6 lines.
